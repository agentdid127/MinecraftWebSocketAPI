# Minecraft WebSocket Api

This is a Java API implementation of the new Minecraft Server API.

This is a feature that was added in 25w35a, and is really interesting!

I quickly threw this together in a livestream, and go this going.

Right now, it supports about half of the features that the API supports.

The snapshot has a couple of issues with documentation, so that will need to be addressed.
